# About Fertility Awareness
Welcome to Fertility Awareness, your AI-powered guide and app for women's hormonal health and fertility. Launched on February 24, 2023, by Emma Hager and currently being developed by WOWEN, we are trailblazers in this field. We believe that fertility knowledge shouldn't be a luxury available to only a few or hidden behind barriers. It's basic biology‚Äîessential, not rocket science‚Äîand a vital foundation for women to feel good and maintain hormonal balance. Yet, this knowledge is rarely taught or commonly understood by women or men. That's why we're committed to democratizing access. Our AI and app function as an educational resource and a foundation for personalized fertility services. Driven by a passion for tech innovation, our mission is to provide reliable tools to help manage reproductive health with confidence. Read more about this project in our Insights post [World's First Fertility Awareness AI: Democratizing Health Wisdom for Every Woman](https://wowen.tech/insights/worlds-first-fertility-awareness-ai/).
